/** 220519
 * Absolute Java
 * Chapter4
 * 3. Define a class called Vehicle that will be used to check the amount of
 * fuel left in a vehicle after traveling a certain distance. The class should
 * have the instance variable tankSize to store the initial size of the tank and
 * efficiency to store initial efficiency of the vehicle.
 * Set to zero the variable fuelInTank that is used to store the initial amount
 * of fuel in a tank. Include a mutator method that returns iniTankSize,
 * initEfficiency and fuelInTank.
 * Include an accessor method addPetrol that calculates how much fuel can be
 * filled depending on the fuel existing in the tank and the tankâ€™s capacity.
 * Also, include a method driveTo that returns what distance can be traveled
 * with the available fuel and provided efficiency. Use your class with a test
 * program. You should decide which variables should be public, if any. Also,
 * define if any other method(s) are needed.
