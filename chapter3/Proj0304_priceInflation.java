 * 4. It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices
 * are not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply
 * use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils two years from now. Because of
 * inflation, the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program
 * to gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The
 * program asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that the
 * item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then outputs
 * the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have the user
 * enter the inflation rate as a percentage, such as 5.6 (percent). Your program
 * should then convert the percent to a fraction, such as 0.056 and should use a
 * loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation.

Enter the cost of the item ($): 
1.50
Enter the number of years from now: 
2
Enter the rate of inflation in percent (%): 
5.6
The price adjusted for inflation is $1.67.
