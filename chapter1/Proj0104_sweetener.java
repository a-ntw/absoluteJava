 * Absolute Java
 * Chapter1 Programming Projects
 * 4. A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener
 * commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend
 * of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend
 * wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as
 * a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The program has no input but
 * does have defined constants for the following items: the amount of artificial
 * sweetener needed to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting
 * weight of the dieter, and  the desired weight of the dieter.
 * To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses the weight at
 * which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current weight,
 * to calculate how much soda pop the dieter can safely drink. You may use any
 * reasonable values for these defined constants.
 * Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another
 * named constant for this fraction. You may want to express the percent as the
 * double value 0.001. (If your program turns out not to use a defined constant,
 * you may remove that defined constant from your program.)
